This is a list of the problems that I need to work solutions for:
=================================================================

- In Windows we know all system DLLs are going to load at the same address for a
particular restart. I don't know if this is the case in Linux. Either way I am 
going to need to figure out how to actually get the address of a function, like printf.
    - turns out the approch in linux is completely different. Instead you act like a debugger
        which gives you free reign in the process
- Admin privleges???
- 64-bit compatibility...
